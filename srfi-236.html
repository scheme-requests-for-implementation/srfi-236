    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This SRFI defines the <code>independently</code> syntax, which can be
    used to combine side effects into one expression without
    specifying their relative order.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <p>There are none at present.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>The purpose of the <code>begin</code> expression type in the
      existing Scheme standards is two-fold.  Firstly, it can be used to
      combine several expressions into one expression.  Secondly, it is
      used to sequence the side effects of these expressions by
      specifying an evaluation order.</p>

    <p>In many use cases, only the first property is needed while any
      specific sequence order would be arbitrary.  Thus, many Scheme
      programs written with <code>begin</code> overspecify the
      underlying algorithm.  As Scheme is a language to write down
      algorithms as much as it is a practical programming language,
      this SRFI introduces the <code>independently</code> syntax, which is
      similar to <code>begin</code> but without any specific
      evaluation order (and thus no return value(s)).</p>

    <p>The practical side of the <code>independently</code> syntax is that
      it allows a compiler to reorder expressions freely and that it
      helps documenting code.  If expressions appear inside
      an <code>independently</code> form, the programmer expresses the fact
      that the relative order of these expressions does not matter.
      This can make imperatively-written programs easier to
      understand.</p>

    <p>As the result of an <code>independently</code> expression is
      unspecified, an <code>independently</code> expression, contrary to
      a <code>begin</code> expression, need not contain any
      expression.  This can make an <code>independently</code> expression
      useful for macro writers.</p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>The following procedure could have been written
      with <code>begin</code> instead of <code>independently</code> but it
      would have been an overspecification of the underlying
      algorithmic content.</p>

    <pre>(define set-car+cdr!
  (lambda (p x y)
    (assert (pair? p))
    (independently
      (set-car! p x)
      (set-cdr! p y))))</pre>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p><code>(independently &langle;expression&rangle; &hellip;)</code></p>

    <p>Evaluates the &langle;expressions&rangle;s in an unspecified
      order and discards their return values.  The result of
      the <code>independently</code> expression is unspecified.</p>

    <p><i>Note:</i> Although the order of evaluation is otherwise
      unspecified, the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the
      &langle;expressions&rangle; is constrained to be consistent with
      some sequential order of evaluation. The order of evaluation may
      be chosen differently for each evaluation of
      the <code>independently</code> form.</p>

    <h3>Library name</h3>

    <p>The <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-97/">SRFI 97</a>-conformant
      library name of this SRFI is <code>(srfi :236 independently)</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>The following is an R<sup>6</sup>RS implementation.</p>

    <pre>(library (srfi :236 independently)
  (export independently)
  (import (rnrs))
  (define-syntax independently
    (lambda (stx)
      (syntax-case stx ()
        [(_ expr ...)
         (with-syntax ([(tmp ...) (generate-temporaries #'(expr ...))])
           #'(let ([tmp (begin expr #f)] ...) (values)))]
        [_ (syntax-violation 'independently "invalid syntax" stx)]))))</pre>

    <p>And here is an R<sup>7</sup>RS (small) implementation.</p>

    <pre>(define-library (srfi 236)
  (export independently)
  (import (scheme base))
  (begin
    (define-syntax independently
      (syntax-rules ()
	((independently expr ...)
	 (independently-aux (expr ...)))))
    (define-syntax independently-aux
      (syntax-rules ()
	((independently-aux () (expr tmp) ...)
	 (let ((tmp (begin expr #f)) ...) (values)))
	((independently-aux (expr . exprs) . binds)
	 (independently-aux exprs (expr tmp) . binds))))))</pre>

    <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>Thanks go to the members of the Scheme Working Group 2 for
      discussing the idea of the <code>independently</code> expression
      with me.  The name <code>independently</code> was suggested by
      Lassi Kortela.  Special thanks to GÃ¶ran Weinholt, who tested the
      previous sample implementation on his Loko compiler and on Chez
      Scheme.</p>
